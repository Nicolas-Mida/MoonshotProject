# TennisPlus

## What is it ?

TennisPlus is an AI that will be able to referee a tennis match exactly like a human referee. 

## How does it work ?

TennisPlus will be based on computer vision and machine learning. It will be able to detect the ball, the lines and the players on the court. Additionally, sensors will be used ensure the accuracy especially for the lines.

To display the data, a smartphone based application will be used.

## Problems 

Today, a lot of problems are encountered in refereeing a tennis match. 

- The first one is the lack of referee on the court. The referee is the only one who can decide if a point is won or not. If the referee is not on the court, the players will have to decide themselves.

- The second problem is related to the previous one : conflicts could happen between the players. 

- A third problem is the Hawk-Eye system which is a expensive tracking system that is used to detect the ball. It is only used on the most important tournaments such as the Grand Slam. However local clubs or smaller tournaments cannot afford it.

## Current advancements

I did a lot of research on the subject such as :

- Marketing research : Any existing product ? How to make it better ? How to make it more attractive ?

- Technical research : How to detect the ball, the lines and the players on the court. Which technologies to use ? How computer vision and machine learning works ? Which sensors to use ? 

- Business research : How to make it sustainable ? How to get the money to develop it ? Where can I get stuffs ?

- Legal research : How to protect the intellectual property ? How to get the rights to use the data ? Can I use public data ?s

A lot of research still needs to be done
